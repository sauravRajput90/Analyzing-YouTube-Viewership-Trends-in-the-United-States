# OVERVIEW OF THE TASK 

# Exploratory Data Analysis
In data preparation, Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is the development of the first idea and hypothesis about the data. Understanding of how to build the data structure and what pre-processing is indeed requires understanding of the general characteristics, classification, features, and potential associations and relations within the data. This is critical for the subsequent modeling and analysis decisions to be well-informed.

## Key Libraries:
-__Pandas:__ Manipulation and analysis of data is done through these systems.  
-__Matplotlib:__ For the general creation of static, animated and interactive data graphics.  
-__Seaborn:__ In order to produce the visual aids such as the rectangles and bars which are helpful and attractive.  
-__numpy:__ Contains functions that enable fast numerical computations involving the arrays and matrices.
-__os:__ Includes methods for executing shell commands and working with processes and files on the operating system.  
-__datetime:__ Specifies classes in working with date and time values.

## Data Loading:
Read your data set into an appropriate data structure.  
## Data Overview: 
-__Shape:__ Verify the row and the column count.
-__Data Types:__ Categorize all the features in the dataset into numerical and categorical data.
-__Missing Values:__ Find out which values are missing and how to proceed with a given case.
## Summary Statistics: 
Determine descriptive statistical measures for numerical variables such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values, and quartiles.Categorically identify the given BodyMassIndex variable and look at its overall distribution.  
## Data Visualization:
Lets make some graphs such as histograms and scatter plots to grasp the patterns and connections, in the data better.Create visualizations like histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to understand data distributions, relationships, and trends.
## Data Cleaning:
Address issues like outliers, inconsistencies, and duplicates. 
## Feature Engineering:
Consider creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance. 
## Outlier Detection:
Having done the identification of outliers, the following methods should be used; box plots, scatter plots, or z-scores.
The case of outliers should be addressed by means of either eliminating them, limiting or transforming them.

# Key Questions to Address During EDA:
Challenges/questions Before doing any further treatement to the data, we need explore it in such way that we should be able to derive some insights which will help us gain few believe_full mannered questiones.
How distributed is the data overall?
Where are their outliers and anomalies?
Are there any missing values?
Any relationships between variables?
What have you observed in your data that other people may not know?
